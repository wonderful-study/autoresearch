# Claude Autoresearch Skill

> Turn [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) into a relentless improvement engine.

Based on [Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) — the principle that **constraint + mechanical metric + autonomous iteration = compounding gains**.

## What Is This?

A [Claude Code skill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) that makes Claude iterate autonomously on ANY task with a measurable outcome — like Karpathy's autoresearch, but generalized beyond ML.

```
You set the GOAL → Claude runs the LOOP → You wake up to results
```

**The loop:**

```
LOOP FOREVER:
  1. Review current state + git history + results log
  2. Pick the next change (based on what worked, what failed, what's untried)
  3. Make ONE focused change
  4. Git commit (before verification)
  5. Run mechanical verification (tests, benchmarks, scores)
  6. If improved → keep. If worse → git revert. If crashed → fix or skip.
  7. Log the result
  8. Repeat. NEVER STOP. NEVER ASK "should I continue?"
```

Every improvement stacks. Every failure auto-reverts. Progress is logged in TSV format.

---

## Why This Exists

[Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) demonstrated that a 630-line Python script could autonomously improve ML models overnight — **100 experiments per night** — by following simple principles:

- **One metric** (validation loss)
- **Constrained scope** (one file)
- **Fast verification** (5-minute training runs)
- **Automatic rollback** on failure
- **Git as memory** for tracking what worked

**Claude Autoresearch generalizes these principles to ANY domain.** Not just ML — software engineering, content, sales, marketing, HR, operations, or anything with a number you can measure.

The insight: **autonomy scales when you constrain scope, clarify success, and mechanize verification.**

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Skill

Clone this repo and copy the skill to your Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/uditgoenka/autoresearch.git

# Copy to your project's Claude Code skills
cp -r autoresearch/skills/autoresearch .claude/skills/autoresearch
```

Or copy directly into your global skills:

```bash
cp -r autoresearch/skills/autoresearch ~/.claude/skills/autoresearch
```

### 2. Invoke It

Open Claude Code in your project and run:

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Increase test coverage from 72% to 90%
Scope: src/**/*.test.ts, src/**/*.ts
Metric: coverage % (higher is better)
Verify: npm test -- --coverage | grep "All files"
```

Or use the namespaced trigger:

```
/ug:autoresearch
Goal: Reduce bundle size below 200KB
Scope: src/**/*.tsx, src/**/*.ts
Metric: bundle size in KB (lower is better)
Verify: npm run build 2>&1 | grep "First Load JS"
```

### 3. Walk Away

Claude will:
1. Read all in-scope files
2. Establish a baseline measurement
3. Start iterating — one change at a time
4. Keep improvements, auto-revert failures
5. Log every iteration in `autoresearch-results.tsv`
6. Print a summary every 10 iterations
7. **Never stop until you interrupt**

---

## How It Works

### The Setup Phase

Before looping, Claude performs a one-time setup:

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Read context | Reads all in-scope files for full understanding |
| 2. Define goal | Extracts or asks for a mechanical metric |
| 3. Define scope | Identifies which files can be modified vs read-only |
| 4. Create results log | Initializes `autoresearch-results.tsv` |
| 5. Establish baseline | Runs verification on current state (iteration #0) |
| 6. Confirm and go | Shows setup to user, then begins the loop |

### The Autonomous Loop

Each iteration follows an 8-phase protocol:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                     │
│  Phase 1: REVIEW                                    │
│  Read current files + git log + results log         │
│                                                     │
│  Phase 2: IDEATE                                    │
│  Pick next change based on patterns and gaps        │
│                                                     │
│  Phase 3: MODIFY                                    │
│  Make ONE atomic change (explainable in 1 sentence) │
│                                                     │
│  Phase 4: COMMIT                                    │
│  Git commit BEFORE verification (clean rollback)    │
│                                                     │
│  Phase 5: VERIFY                                    │
│  Run mechanical metric command                      │
│                                                     │
│  Phase 6: DECIDE                                    │
│  Improved → keep | Worse → revert | Crash → fix    │
│                                                     │
│  Phase 7: LOG                                       │
│  Append result to autoresearch-results.tsv          │
│                                                     │
│  Phase 8: REPEAT                                    │
│  Go to Phase 1. NEVER STOP.                         │
│                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Results Tracking

Every iteration is logged in TSV format:

```tsv
iteration	commit	metric	delta	status	description
0	a1b2c3d	85.2	0.0	baseline	initial state — test coverage 85.2%
1	b2c3d4e	87.1	+1.9	keep	add tests for auth middleware edge cases
2	-	86.5	-0.6	discard	refactor test helpers (broke 2 tests)
3	-	0.0	0.0	crash	add integration tests (DB connection failed)
4	c3d4e5f	88.3	+1.2	keep	add tests for error handling in API routes
5	d4e5f6g	89.0	+0.7	keep	add boundary value tests for validators
```

Every 10 iterations, Claude prints a summary:

```
=== Autoresearch Progress (iteration 20) ===
Baseline: 85.2% → Current best: 92.1% (+6.9%)
Keeps: 8 | Discards: 10 | Crashes: 2
Last 5: keep, discard, discard, keep, keep
```

## Combining with MCP Servers

Claude Code supports [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers, which give Claude access to external tools and APIs. When combined with autoresearch, this unlocks **real-time data-driven iteration loops**.

### How It Works

MCP servers expose tools that Claude can call during the autoresearch loop. Instead of just reading files and running scripts, Claude can:

- **Query databases** to verify data changes
- **Call APIs** to test integrations
- **Fetch analytics** to measure real-world impact
- **Interact with external services** as part of verification

### Pattern: Database-Driven Iteration

Use a PostgreSQL MCP server to iterate on query performance:

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Optimize slow dashboard queries — reduce p95 query time
Scope: queries/dashboard/*.sql
Metric: avg query time in ms (lower is better)
Verify: Use MCP postgres tool to run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on each query, sum total costs
```

Claude rewrites queries one at a time, uses the MCP Postgres tool to benchmark each change, and keeps only improvements.

### Pattern: API Integration Testing

Use an HTTP/API MCP server to verify endpoint behavior:

```
/autoresearch
Goal: All API endpoints return valid JSON with correct status codes in <200ms
Scope: src/api/**/*.ts
Metric: endpoints passing all checks (higher is better)
Verify: Use MCP HTTP tool to hit each endpoint, validate response schema + timing
```

### Pattern: Analytics-Driven Content Optimization

Use a Google Analytics or Plausible MCP server:

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Improve blog post structure based on engagement metrics
Scope: content/blog/*.md
Metric: avg time on page for modified posts (higher is better)
Verify: Use MCP analytics tool to fetch page metrics, compare against baseline
```

### Pattern: CRM + Sales Automation

Use a HubSpot/Salesforce MCP server:

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Optimize email templates based on actual open/reply rates
Scope: content/email-templates/*.md
Metric: avg open rate from CRM data (higher is better)
Verify: Use MCP CRM tool to pull latest campaign metrics for template variants
```

### Pattern: Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring

Use an AWS/GCP MCP server:

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Reduce Lambda cold start times across all functions
Scope: src/lambdas/**/*.ts
Metric: avg cold start time in ms (lower is better)
Verify: Use MCP CloudWatch tool to query p95 cold start durations
```

### Pattern: GitHub Issue Triage

Use the GitHub MCP server:

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Auto-label and categorize 100+ open issues by type and priority
Scope: scripts/issue-triage.js
Metric: issues correctly labeled (higher is better)
Verify: Use MCP GitHub tool to fetch issues, compare labels against rules
```

### Recommended MCP Servers for Autoresearch

| MCP Server | Use Case | Metric Source |
|---|---|---|
| **PostgreSQL** | Query optimization, data validation | Query execution time, row counts |
| **GitHub** | Issue triage, PR quality, CI status | Issue counts, check pass rates |
| **Filesystem** | File organization, cleanup | File counts, directory depth |
| **Puppeteer/Playwright** | Visual regression, performance | Lighthouse scores, screenshot diffs |
| **Slack** | Notification quality, alert tuning | Message delivery, response times |
| **Stripe** | Payment flow optimization | Checkout completion rates |
| **Sentry** | Error reduction | Error count, crash-free rate |
| **Cloudflare** | Edge performance | Cache hit rate, TTFB |

---

## Combining with APIs

Beyond MCP, Claude can call APIs directly via scripts in the verification step. This enables real-world measurement loops.

### Pattern: Lighthouse via API

```javascript
// scripts/lighthouse-score.js
const { exec } = require('child_process');
exec('npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --output json --quiet', (err, stdout) => {
  const report = JSON.parse(stdout);
  const perf = report.categories.performance.score * 100;
  console.log(`SCORE: ${perf}`);
  process.exit(perf > 0 ? 0 : 1);
});
```

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Lighthouse performance score above 95
Scope: src/components/**/*.tsx, src/app/**/*.tsx
Metric: Lighthouse performance score (higher is better)
Verify: node scripts/lighthouse-score.js
```

### Pattern: OpenAI/Anthropic API for Content Scoring

Use an LLM API call as the verification step to score content quality:

```javascript
// scripts/content-quality-scorer.js
const Anthropic = require('@anthropic-ai/sdk');
const fs = require('fs');

const content = fs.readFileSync(process.argv[2], 'utf-8');
const client = new Anthropic();

async function score() {
  const msg = await client.messages.create({
    model: 'claude-haiku-4-5-20251001',
    max_tokens: 100,
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: `Score this content 0-100 for clarity, engagement, and SEO. Return ONLY a number.\n\n${content}` }]
  });
  const score = parseInt(msg.content[0].text.trim());
  console.log(`SCORE: ${score}`);
  process.exit(0);
}
score();
```

```
/autoresearch
Goal: All blog posts score 80+ on AI-assessed quality
Scope: content/blog/*.md
Metric: quality score from Haiku (higher is better)
Verify: node scripts/content-quality-scorer.js content/blog/latest.md
```

### Pattern: PageSpeed Insights API

```javascript
// scripts/pagespeed-score.js
const https = require('https');
const url = `https://www.googleapis.com/pagespeedonline/v5/runPagespeed?url=${process.argv[2]}&key=${process.env.PSI_API_KEY}`;
https.get(url, res => {
  let data = '';
  res.on('data', chunk => data += chunk);
  res.on('end', () => {
    const score = JSON.parse(data).lighthouseResult.categories.performance.score * 100;
    console.log(`SCORE: ${score}`);
  });
});
```

### Pattern: Stripe Checkout Flow Testing

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Reduce checkout page load time and increase Stripe test payment success rate
Scope: src/checkout/**/*.tsx
Metric: checkout flow success rate % (higher is better)
Verify: node scripts/test-checkout-flow.js
```

### Pattern: Email Deliverability Scoring

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Improve email deliverability — reduce spam score across all templates
Scope: content/email-templates/*.html
Metric: SpamAssassin score (lower is better)
Verify: node scripts/spam-score.js content/email-templates/
```

---

## Claude Code Patterns

### Pattern 1: "Run Overnight"

Tell Claude to iterate while you sleep. The loop never stops until you interrupt.

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Improve lighthouse score from 72 to 95+
I'm going to sleep — iterate all night. Don't ask me anything.
```

### Pattern 2: "Compound Improvements"

Stack small wins. Each kept commit builds on the last.

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Reduce TypeScript errors from 47 to 0
Start with the easiest fixes. Build momentum. Save hardest for last.
```

### Pattern 3: "Explore and Exploit"

Let Claude try bold experiments, auto-reverting failures.

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Reduce API response time
Try radical approaches too — different data structures, caching strategies, query rewrites.
If stuck after 5 discards, try something completely different.
```

### Pattern 4: "Refactor Without Breaking"

Safe refactoring with automatic rollback safety net.

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Reduce lines of code in src/services/ by 30% while keeping all tests green
Metric: LOC count (lower is better)
Verify: npm test && find src/services -name "*.ts" | xargs wc -l | tail -1
```

### Pattern 5: "Content Factory"

Batch-produce content that meets quality gates.

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Write 20 blog post outlines, each with 5+ sections, 3+ internal link opportunities
Scope: content/outlines/*.md
Metric: outlines meeting criteria (higher is better)
Verify: node scripts/outline-validator.js
```

### Pattern 6: "Progressive Hardening"

Start lenient, tighten criteria as baseline improves.

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Phase 1 — all tests pass. Phase 2 — coverage >80%. Phase 3 — zero linting errors.
Advance to next phase only when current is stable for 3 consecutive iterations.
```

## Writing Verification Scripts

The skill works best when verification is **fast and mechanical**. Here's a template:

```javascript
// scripts/score-example.js — Template for custom scoring
const fs = require('fs');
const file = process.argv[2];
const content = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf-8');

// Your scoring logic here
const score = content.split('\n').filter(l => l.startsWith('- ')).length;

// Output MUST be a single number on its own line for easy parsing
console.log(`SCORE: ${score}`);
process.exit(score > 0 ? 0 : 1);
```

**Rules for good verification:**

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Runs in under 10 seconds | Fast = more iterations = more experiments |
| Outputs a single parseable number | Claude needs to extract the metric mechanically |
| Exit code 0 = success, non-zero = crash | Clean pass/fail signal |
| No human judgment required | Agent must decide autonomously |
| Deterministic (same input = same output) | Non-deterministic metrics break the feedback loop |

---

## Core Principles

These 7 principles are extracted from [Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) and generalized to any domain:

### 1. Constraint = Enabler

Autonomy succeeds through intentional constraint, not despite it.

| Autoresearch | Generalized |
|---|---|
| 630-line codebase | Bounded scope that fits agent context |
| 5-minute time budget | Fixed iteration cost |
| One metric (val_bpb) | Single mechanical success criterion |

### 2. Separate Strategy from Tactics

Humans set direction (**what** to improve). Agents execute iterations (**how** to improve it).

| Strategic (Human) | Tactical (Agent) |
|---|---|
| "Improve page load speed" | "Lazy-load images, code-split routes" |
| "Increase test coverage" | "Add tests for uncovered edge cases" |
| "Refactor auth module" | "Extract middleware, simplify handlers" |

### 3. Metrics Must Be Mechanical

If you can't verify with a command, you can't iterate autonomously.

**Good:** `npm test -- --coverage | grep "All files"` → outputs `87.3%`

**Bad:** "Looks better", "probably improved", "seems cleaner" → kills the loop.

### 4. Verification Must Be Fast

| Fast (enables iteration) | Slow (kills iteration) |
|---|---|
| Unit tests (seconds) | Full E2E suite (minutes) |
| Type check (seconds) | Manual QA (hours) |
| Lint check (instant) | Code review (async) |

### 5. Iteration Cost Shapes Behavior

- **Cheap iteration** → bold exploration, many experiments
- **Expensive iteration** → conservative, few experiments

Autoresearch: 5-minute cost → 100 experiments/night.
Software: 10-second test → 360 experiments/hour.

### 6. Git as Memory

Every successful change is committed. Failures are reverted. This enables causality tracking, stacking wins, pattern learning, and human review.

### 7. Honest Limitations

If the agent hits a wall (missing permissions, external dependency, needs human judgment), it says so clearly instead of guessing.

## 8 Critical Rules

These rules govern Claude's behavior during the autonomous loop:

| # | Rule | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| 1 | **NEVER STOP** | Loop until manually interrupted. User may be asleep. |
| 2 | **Read before write** | Always understand full context before modifying. |
| 3 | **One change per iteration** | Atomic changes — if it breaks, you know exactly why. |
| 4 | **Mechanical verification only** | No subjective "looks good." Use metrics. |
| 5 | **Automatic rollback** | Failed changes revert instantly. No debates. |
| 6 | **Simplicity wins** | Equal results + less code = KEEP. Tiny gain + ugly complexity = DISCARD. |
| 7 | **Git is memory** | Every kept change committed. Agent reads history to learn patterns. |
| 8 | **When stuck, think harder** | Re-read files, combine near-misses, try radical changes. |

---

## Crash Recovery

Claude handles failures automatically:

| Failure Type | Response |
|---|---|
| Syntax error | Fix immediately, don't count as separate iteration |
| Runtime error | Attempt fix (max 3 tries), then move on |
| Resource exhaustion (OOM) | Revert, try smaller variant |
| Infinite loop / hang | Kill after timeout, revert, avoid that approach |
| External dependency failure | Skip, log, try different approach |

## About Karpathy's Autoresearch

[Autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) is Andrej Karpathy's framework for autonomous ML research. Key insights:

- **630 lines of Python** — intentionally small so an LLM can hold the entire codebase in context
- **One GPU, one file, one metric** — constraints enable autonomy
- **5-minute training runs** — cheap iterations mean bold experiments
- **100 experiments per night** — compound gains while humans sleep
- **Git as memory** — every experiment tracked, successes committed, failures reverted

**Claude Autoresearch takes these principles and generalizes them.** Instead of training ML models, Claude can autonomously iterate on:

- Code quality (tests, coverage, performance, bundle size)
- Content quality (readability, SEO, keyword density)
- Documentation (completeness, clarity, compliance)
- Any task where "better" = a number you can measure with a command

The meta-principle:

> Autonomy scales when you constrain scope, clarify success, mechanize verification, and let agents optimize tactics while humans optimize strategy.

## FAQ

**Q: Does this work with any Claude Code project?**
A: Yes. Copy the skill to `.claude/skills/autoresearch/` in any project. It works with any language, framework, or domain.

**Q: How do I stop the loop?**
A: Press `Ctrl+C` or close the terminal. Claude commits before verifying, so your last successful state is always preserved in git.

**Q: What if my verification takes too long?**
A: Aim for under 10 seconds. Longer verification = fewer experiments = slower progress. Use the fastest check that still catches real problems.

**Q: Can I use this for non-code tasks?**
A: Absolutely. Sales emails, marketing copy, HR policies, runbooks — anything with a measurable metric. See the examples above.

**Q: What happens if Claude gets stuck?**
A: After 5+ consecutive discards, Claude automatically: re-reads all files, reviews the results log for patterns, tries combining near-misses, attempts the opposite of what hasn't been working, and tries radical changes.

**Q: Is the results log committed to git?**
A: No. Add `autoresearch-results.tsv` to `.gitignore`. It's a working file for the agent, not part of your codebase.

**Q: Can I review what Claude did?**
A: Yes. Every kept change is a git commit with a descriptive message. Run `git log --oneline` to see the full history of experiments.

**Q: Can I use MCP servers with autoresearch?**
A: Yes. Any MCP server configured in your Claude Code environment is available during the loop. Claude can query databases, call APIs, fetch analytics, and interact with external services as part of the verification step. See the "Combining with MCP Servers" section above.

**Q: Can I use an LLM API call as the verification metric?**
A: Yes, but carefully. Use a fast, cheap model (like Haiku) for scoring. The verification must be deterministic-ish — same content should score similarly. Avoid using the same model that's making the changes to score them (confirmation bias). See the API patterns section for examples.

**Q: What about rate limits when using APIs for verification?**
A: Add a small delay in your verification script if needed. The loop is still fast — even with a 2-second API call, you get 1,800 iterations per hour. Most API rate limits won't be hit at this pace.

### Why I Built This

I use Claude Code daily to build products across all my ventures. When I saw Karpathy's autoresearch, I realized the same principles could make Claude Code dramatically more productive for **any** domain — not just ML research. Claude Autoresearch is how I let Claude work autonomously on tasks while I focus on strategy.
