## Why This Exists

[Karpathy's autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch) demonstrated that a 630-line Python script could autonomously improve ML models overnight — **100 experiments per night** — by following simple principles: one metric, constrained scope, fast verification, automatic rollback, git as memory.

**Claude Autoresearch generalizes these principles to ANY domain.** Not just ML — code, content, marketing, sales, HR, DevOps, or anything with a number you can measure.

---

## How It Works

```
LOOP (FOREVER or N times):
  1. Review current state + git history + results log
  2. Pick the next change (based on what worked, what failed, what's untried)
  3. Make ONE focused change
  4. Git commit (before verification)
  5. Run mechanical verification (tests, benchmarks, scores)
  6. If improved → keep. If worse → git revert. If crashed → fix or skip.
  7. Log the result
  8. Repeat. Never stop until you interrupt (or N iterations complete).
```

Every improvement stacks. Every failure auto-reverts. Progress is logged in TSV format.

### The Setup Phase

Before looping, Claude performs a one-time setup:

1. **Read context** — reads all in-scope files
2. **Define goal** — extracts or asks for a mechanical metric
3. **Define scope** — which files can be modified vs read-only
4. **Establish baseline** — runs verification on current state (iteration #0)
5. **Confirm and go** — shows setup, then begins the loop

### 8 Critical Rules

| # | Rule |
|---|------|
| 1 | **Loop until done** — unbounded: forever. Bounded: N times then summarize |
| 2 | **Read before write** — understand full context before modifying |
| 3 | **One change per iteration** — atomic changes. If it breaks, you know why |
| 4 | **Mechanical verification only** — no subjective "looks good." Use metrics |
| 5 | **Automatic rollback** — failed changes revert instantly |
| 6 | **Simplicity wins** — equal results + less code = KEEP |
| 7 | **Git is memory** — every kept change committed |
| 8 | **When stuck, think harder** — re-read, combine near-misses, try radical changes |

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/autoresearch` | Run the autonomous iteration loop (unlimited) |
| `/loop N /autoresearch` | Run exactly N iterations then stop |
| `/autoresearch:plan` | Interactive wizard: Goal → Scope, Metric, Verify config |
| `/autoresearch:security` | Autonomous STRIDE + OWASP + red-team security audit |
| `/autoresearch:ship` | Universal shipping workflow (code, content, marketing, sales, research, design) |
| `Guard: <command>` | Optional safety net — must pass for changes to be kept |

### Quick Decision Guide

| I want to... | Use |
|--------------|-----|
| Improve test coverage / reduce bundle size / any metric | `/autoresearch` or `/loop N /autoresearch` |
| Don't know what metric to use | `/autoresearch:plan` |
| Run a security audit | `/autoresearch:security` |
| Ship a PR / deployment / release | `/autoresearch:ship` |
| Optimize without breaking existing tests | Add `Guard: npm test` |
| Check if something is ready to ship | `/autoresearch:ship --checklist-only` |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

**Option A — Plugin install (recommended):**

```bash
/plugin install autoresearch@autoresearch
```

Or add to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "autoresearch": {
      "source": { "source": "git", "url": "https://github.com/uditgoenka/autoresearch.git" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B — Manual copy:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uditgoenka/autoresearch.git

# Copy skill + subcommands to your project
cp -r autoresearch/skills/autoresearch .claude/skills/autoresearch
cp -r autoresearch/commands/autoresearch .claude/commands/autoresearch
```

Or install globally:

```bash
cp -r autoresearch/skills/autoresearch ~/.claude/skills/autoresearch
cp -r autoresearch/commands/autoresearch ~/.claude/commands/autoresearch
```

> **Note:** The `commands/` directory is required for subcommands (`/autoresearch:ship`, `/autoresearch:plan`, `/autoresearch:security`) to work.

### 2. Run It

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Increase test coverage from 72% to 90%
Scope: src/**/*.test.ts, src/**/*.ts
Metric: coverage % (higher is better)
Verify: npm test -- --coverage | grep "All files"
```

### 3. Walk Away

Claude reads all files, establishes a baseline, and starts iterating — one change at a time. Keep improvements, auto-revert failures, log everything. **Never stops until you interrupt** (or N iterations complete).

---

## /autoresearch:plan — Goal → Config Wizard

The hardest part isn't the loop — it's defining Scope, Metric, and Verify correctly. `/autoresearch:plan` converts your plain-language goal into a validated, ready-to-execute configuration.

```
/autoresearch:plan
Goal: Make the API respond faster
```

The wizard walks you through 5 steps: capture goal → define scope → define metric → define direction → validate verify command (dry-run). Every gate is mechanical — scope must resolve to files, metric must output a number, verify must pass a dry-run.

---

## /autoresearch:security — Autonomous Security Audit

Read-only security audit using STRIDE threat modeling, OWASP Top 10 sweeps, and red-team adversarial analysis with 4 hostile personas.

```
/loop 10 /autoresearch:security
```

**What it does:** Codebase recon → asset inventory → trust boundaries → STRIDE threat model → attack surface map → autonomous testing loop → structured report.

Every finding requires **code evidence** (file:line + attack scenario). No theoretical fluff.

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--diff` | Only audit files changed since last audit |
| `--fix` | Auto-fix confirmed Critical/High findings |
| `--fail-on <severity>` | Exit non-zero for CI/CD gating |

**Output:** Creates `security/{date}-{slug}/` with 7 structured report files.

---

## /autoresearch:ship — Universal Shipping Workflow

Ship anything through 8 phases: **Identify → Inventory → Checklist → Prepare → Dry-run → Ship → Verify → Log.**

```
/autoresearch:ship --auto
```

Auto-detects what you're shipping (code PR, deployment, blog post, email campaign, sales deck, research paper, design assets) and generates domain-specific checklists — every item mechanically verifiable.

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--dry-run` | Validate everything but don't ship |
| `--auto` | Auto-approve if checklist passes |
| `--force` | Skip non-critical items (blockers still enforced) |
| `--rollback` | Undo last ship action |
| `--monitor N` | Post-ship monitoring for N minutes |
| `--type <type>` | Override auto-detection |
| `--checklist-only` | Just check readiness |

**9 supported types:** code-pr, code-release, deployment, content, marketing-email, marketing-campaign, sales, research, design.

---

## Guard — Prevent Regressions (v1.0.4)

When optimizing a metric, the loop might break existing behavior. **Guard** is an optional safety net.

```
/autoresearch
Goal: Reduce API response time to under 100ms
Verify: npm run bench:api | grep "p95"
Guard: npm test
```

- **Verify** = "Did the metric improve?" (the goal)
- **Guard** = "Did anything else break?" (the safety net)

If the metric improves but the guard fails, Claude reworks the optimization (up to 2 attempts). Guard/test files are never modified.

> **Credit:** Guard was contributed by [@pronskiy](https://github.com/pronskiy) (JetBrains) in [PR #7](https://github.com/uditgoenka/autoresearch/pull/7).

## Results Tracking

Every iteration is logged in TSV format:

```tsv
iteration  commit   metric  delta   status    description
0          a1b2c3d  85.2    0.0     baseline  initial state
1          b2c3d4e  87.1    +1.9    keep      add tests for auth edge cases
2          -        86.5    -0.6    discard   refactor test helpers (broke 2 tests)
3          c3d4e5f  88.3    +1.2    keep      add error handling tests
```

Every 10 iterations, Claude prints a progress summary. Bounded loops print a final summary with baseline → current best.

---

## Crash Recovery

| Failure | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Syntax error | Fix immediately, don't count as iteration |
| Runtime error | Attempt fix (max 3 tries), then move on |
| Resource exhaustion | Revert, try smaller variant |
| Infinite loop / hang | Kill after timeout, revert |
| External dependency | Skip, log, try different approach |

## FAQ

**Q: I don't know what metric to use.**
A: Run `/autoresearch:plan` — it analyzes your codebase, suggests metrics, and dry-runs the verify command before you launch.

**Q: Does this work with any project?**
A: Yes. Any language, framework, or domain. Copy the skill to `.claude/skills/autoresearch/` and the commands to `.claude/commands/autoresearch/`.

**Q: How do I stop the loop?**
A: `Ctrl+C` or use `/loop N /autoresearch` to run exactly N iterations. Claude commits before verifying, so your last successful state is always in git.

**Q: Can I use this for non-code tasks?**
A: Absolutely. Sales emails, marketing copy, HR policies, runbooks — anything with a measurable metric. See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).

**Q: Does /autoresearch:security modify my code?**
A: No. It's read-only — analyzes code and produces a structured report. Use `--fix` to opt into auto-remediation of confirmed Critical/High findings.

**Q: Can I use MCP servers?**
A: Yes. Any MCP server configured in Claude Code is available during the loop for database queries, API calls, analytics, etc. See [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md#combining-with-mcp-servers).
